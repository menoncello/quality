## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories exist - this is the foundational story for the project.

### Data Models

- ProjectConfiguration: Interface for project settings [Source: architecture/data-models.md#projectconfiguration]
- ToolConfiguration: Interface for tool-specific settings [Source: architecture/data-models.md#toolconfiguration]

### API Specifications

- CLI commands will use kebab-case naming convention [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#command-options]
- Main commands: setup, config, analyze, quick, watch, report, export, history [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#main-commands]
- Global options: --verbose, --quiet, --json, --config, --no-cache, --help [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#command-options]

### Component Specifications

- CLI Core component handles command registration and parsing [Source: architecture/components.md#cli-core]
- Use Ink components for consistent CLI interface [Source: architecture/components.md#cli-core]
- Commander.js for command parsing with extensive customization [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### File Locations

- Main CLI application: apps/cli/src/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#full-project-structure]
- Core packages: packages/core/, packages/types/, packages/utils/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#full-project-structure]
- Configuration files: configs/eslint/, configs/typescript/ [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#full-project-structure]
- Tests: apps/cli/tests/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]

### Testing Requirements

- Frontend tests in apps/cli/tests/unit/ and apps/cli/tests/integration/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-tests]
- Backend tests in packages/\*/tests/ [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- Use Vitest for frontend unit testing and Bun Test for backend testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Test examples provided for component testing, API testing, and E2E testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]

### Technical Constraints

- Use TypeScript 5.3.3 with strong typing throughout [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for classes/interfaces, camelCase for functions, kebab-case for files [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- Always use path utilities for cross-platform compatibility [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use Bun 1.0.0 as runtime and package manager [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Implement proper error handling for all async operations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Project Structure Notes

The architecture defines a monorepo structure with clear separation between applications and packages. The implementation should follow the exact structure defined in [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#full-project-structure] including:

- apps/cli/ for main CLI application
- packages/ for shared functionality
- configs/ for shared configuration files
- Proper package.json workspaces configuration

## Testing

### Testing Standards

- All core functionality must have unit tests [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Test location: apps/cli/tests/ for CLI components, packages/\*/tests/ for core packages [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Use Vitest for frontend component testing with React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Use Bun Test for backend service and utility testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Follow test pyramid: unit tests → integration tests → E2E tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Test Framework Setup

- Vitest configuration for fast, modern testing with TypeScript support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Bun Test integration for backend test execution and coverage analysis [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Test fixtures should be placed in tests/fixtures/ directories [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

### Specific CLI Test Scenarios

**Unit Tests:**

- CLI command registration and parsing validation
- Package workspace configuration verification

**E2E Tests:**

- Complete setup workflow from scratch
- Development environment initialization
- First-time build and test execution
- Package installation and verification
- Basic CLI command execution (help, version)

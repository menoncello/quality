### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**CLI Command Interface Extensions:**

The analysis engine will integrate with existing CLI commands:

- `dev-quality` - Quick analysis using default tools
- `dev-quality analyze` - Comprehensive analysis with all tools
- `dev-quality quick` - Fast analysis with essential tools only

**Plugin Registration System:**

```typescript
// Built-in plugin registration
const builtinPlugins = [
  new ESLintPlugin(),
  new PrettierPlugin(),
  new TypeScriptPlugin(),
  new BunTestPlugin()
];

// Plugin manager registration
await pluginManager.registerPlugins(builtinPlugins);
```

**Result Aggregation Pipeline:**

```typescript
// Result flow: ToolResult -> Normalizer -> Aggregator -> AnalysisResult
const toolResults = await Promise.all(plugins.map(p => p.execute(context)));
const normalizedResults = await normalizer.normalize(toolResults);
const aggregatedResult = await aggregator.aggregate(normalizedResults);
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Organization:**

- **Unit Tests**: `packages/core/tests/unit/analysis/` for analysis engine components
- **Integration Tests**: `packages/core/tests/integration/analysis/` for complete workflows
- **CLI Tests**: `apps/cli/tests/integration/analysis/` for CLI integration
- **Performance Tests**: `packages/core/tests/performance/` for concurrent execution validation

**Required Test Scenarios:**

1. **Component Tests**: AnalysisEngine, PluginManager, ResultNormalizer, ResultAggregator
2. **Plugin Tests**: Built-in tool adapters with mock project data
3. **Integration Tests**: Complete analysis workflows with multiple tools
4. **Performance Tests**: Concurrent execution with timing benchmarks
5. **Error Handling Tests**: Tool failures, timeouts, and graceful degradation

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

- Core analysis engine functionality: 100% test coverage required
- Plugin system: 100% test coverage with edge cases
- Error handling: All failure scenarios must be tested
- Performance: Validate concurrent execution and timing requirements

**Test Framework Usage:**

- **Bun Test**: For core analysis engine and plugin system testing
- **Vitest**: For CLI component testing with React Testing Library
- **Mock Libraries**: For tool execution mocking and result simulation

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Type Safety:**

- No `any` types allowed - use explicit interfaces or `unknown`
- All async operations must have proper error handling (try-catch)
- Plugin interfaces must be strongly typed with TypeScript generics
- Result normalization must preserve type safety across tool boundaries

**Error Handling Patterns:**

- Wrap all plugin execution in try-catch blocks with specific error types
- Implement timeout handling for all tool execution (default 30 seconds)
- Graceful degradation when individual tools fail
- Detailed error logging with context for debugging

**Performance Standards:**

- Analysis should complete in under 2 minutes for typical projects
- Concurrent execution must use worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
- Cache analysis results to avoid redundant execution
- Memory usage should be optimized for large projects (1000+ files)

**Security Requirements:**

- Plugin sandbox execution to prevent malicious plugin behavior
- Validate all tool inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks
- Path sanitization for all file operations (reuse patterns from story 1.3)
- Resource limits for plugin execution (memory, CPU, file handles)

**Code Quality:**

- No console.log statements - use proper logging utilities
- Consistent naming: camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes/interfaces
- File naming: kebab-case (analysis-engine.ts, plugin-manager.ts)
- Follow repository pattern for data access
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

### Plugin Architecture Patterns

**Plugin Lifecycle:**

1. **Discovery**: Scan for available plugins (built-in and external)
2. **Registration**: Register plugins with dependency validation
3. **Initialization**: Initialize plugins with configuration
4. **Execution**: Execute plugins concurrently with context
5. **Cleanup**: Clean up resources and temporary files

**Result Normalization Strategy:**

Each tool plugin returns standardized ToolResult format:

- Tool name and execution metadata
- Standardized issue format with severity levels
- Tool-specific metrics in structured format
- Coverage data in consistent schema

**Concurrent Execution Architecture:**

- Task scheduler manages plugin execution pool
- Worker threads handle CPU-intensive tool execution
- Event system provides real-time progress updates
- Timeout and cancellation support for long-running tools

### Integration with Existing Components

**Detection Engine Integration:**

- Use AutoConfigurationDetectionEngine for project analysis
- Leverage detection results for tool configuration
- Cache project structure to avoid redundant scans

**Configuration System Integration:**

- Use ProjectConfiguration from wizard (story 1.3)
- Leverage ToolConfiguration interfaces for plugin settings
- Support both wizard-generated and manual configurations

**SQLite Integration:**

- Persist analysis results using existing database schema
- Cache analysis results for incremental analysis
- Store historical analysis data for trend reporting

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Test Isolation:**

- Use timestamp-based directory names for test fixtures to avoid conflicts
- Always clean up test files and temporary data in afterEach hooks
- Mock external tool executions, not internal analysis logic
- Use proper async/await patterns to avoid race conditions in concurrent tests

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

- 100% test coverage for analysis engine core logic
- 100% test coverage for plugin system and built-in adapters
- Edge cases: Empty projects, invalid configurations, tool failures
- Integration: Complete analysis workflows with multiple tools
- Performance: Concurrent execution timing and resource usage

**Test Location:**

- Unit tests: `packages/core/tests/unit/analysis/`
- Integration tests: `packages/core/tests/integration/analysis/`
- CLI integration tests: `apps/cli/tests/integration/analysis/`
- Performance tests: `packages/core/tests/performance/`

**Test Frameworks:**

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Bun Test**: For analysis engine and plugin system testing
- **Vitest**: For CLI component testing with React Testing Library

**Specific Test Scenarios:**

**Unit Tests:**

- AnalysisEngine orchestration with mock plugins
- PluginManager lifecycle and dependency resolution
- ResultNormalizer standardization across different tool outputs
- ResultAggregator scoring algorithms and summary calculations
- TaskScheduler concurrent execution and resource management
- Error handling with tool failures and timeouts
- Cache integration and invalidation

**Integration Tests:**

- Complete analysis workflow with all built-in tools
- Plugin system with custom tool adapters

- Incremental analysis with file changes detection
- CLI integration with real project structures

**Performance Tests:**

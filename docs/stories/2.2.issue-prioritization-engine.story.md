### Security Considerations

**Issue Data Protection** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#security-requirements]

- Issue classification and prioritization may expose sensitive code patterns
- Implement access controls for ML training data and model parameters
- Classification models should be stored securely with proper file permissions
- Triage suggestions should not expose proprietary algorithms or business logic

**ML Model Security**

- Training data should respect .gitignore and exclude sensitive directories
- Model parameters should not be transmitted externally without explicit consent
- Classification rules should protect sensitive code patterns and intellectual property
- User consent workflows for any external AI processing or model improvements

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

**ML Model Failures** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

- Handle ML model loading failures with fallback to rule-based prioritization
- Recover from classification errors without complete prioritization failure
- Validate training data quality and provide helpful error messages for insufficient data
- Implement graceful degradation when models are unavailable or performing poorly

**Data Processing Edge Cases**

- Handle empty issue lists or projects with no identified issues
- Process malformed issue data with proper error recovery
- Manage conflicting prioritization rules with resolution strategies
- Handle insufficient training data for ML model training

**Performance Edge Cases**

- Detect and handle memory pressure during large issue set processing
- Implement incremental prioritization for very large projects
- Provide progress indicators and cancellation options for long-running ML operations
- Cache intermediate results to allow resuming interrupted prioritization analysis

### Project Structure Notes

The auto-configuration detection engine should be implemented within the existing monorepo structure:

- **Core detection logic**: packages/core/src/detection/ - New package for detection utilities
- **Configuration management**: packages/core/src/configuration/ - New package for config handling
- **Setup wizard UI**: apps/cli/src/components/setup-wizard/ - New React components for interactive setup
- **CLI commands**: apps/cli/src/commands/setup.ts - Extend existing setup command
- **Integration points**: Leverage existing Zustand store for state management and Ink for CLI interface

The implementation should follow the exact structure defined in [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md] and integrate seamlessly with the existing CLI framework established in Story 1.1.

### Implementation Approach

#### Project Detection Algorithm

1. **File System Traversal**: Use recursive directory scanning starting from project root
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify key files (package.json, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc\*, etc.)
3. **Content Analysis**: Parse configuration files to extract tool versions and settings
4. **Dependency Graph**: Build dependency tree to understand project relationships
5. **Classification**: Categorize project based on detected patterns and dependencies

#### Configuration Detection Strategy

1. **Multi-format Support**: Detect JSON, YAML, JS, and TypeScript configuration files
2. **Hierarchical Resolution**: Resolve configuration precedence (local → global → default)
3. **Extension Recognition**: Identify framework-specific configurations (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
4. **Validation**: Verify configuration syntax and compatibility with target tools
5. **Migration Analysis**: Identify outdated configurations and suggest updates

#### Error Handling Strategy

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue analysis even if some configurations are malformed
2. **Detailed Reporting**: Provide specific error messages for configuration issues
3. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Attempt fallback parsing methods for common issues
4. **User Guidance**: Offer actionable suggestions for resolving configuration problems
5. **Logging**: Maintain detailed logs for debugging and troubleshooting

#### Performance Requirements

1. **Fast Analysis**: Complete project detection within 2 seconds for typical projects
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Limit memory usage to <50MB for analysis operations
3. **Scalability**: Handle monorepos with 100+ packages efficiently
4. **Concurrent Processing**: Parallelize file parsing and dependency resolution
5. **Incremental Updates**: Support partial re-scanning when files change

#### Caching Strategy

1. **File System Cache**: Cache file metadata and content with change detection
2. **Configuration Cache**: Store parsed configuration objects with TTL
3. **Dependency Cache**: Cache resolved dependency trees and version information
4. **Analysis Results Cache**: Store detection results to avoid redundant processing
5. **Invalidation**: Smart cache invalidation based on file modifications

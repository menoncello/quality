## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `apps/cli/tests/unit/components/`
- Integration tests: `apps/cli/tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `apps/cli/tests/e2e/dashboard-workflows.ts`
- Performance tests: `apps/cli/tests/performance/dashboard-load.ts`
- Security tests: `apps/cli/tests/security/input-validation.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Frontend Testing: Vitest 1.0.0 for Ink components
- Test Runner: Bun Test 1.0.0 for integration tests
- Required Coverage: 90%+ for all new components

**Critical Test Requirements:**
- Performance benchmarks: Must handle 10,000+ issue datasets
- Filter operations must complete within 100ms
- Search operations must return results within 50ms
- Virtual scrolling must handle 1000+ visible items smoothly
- Memory usage must stay under 512MB with large datasets
- Security: All user inputs must be validated for XSS attempts
- Integration: Test priority display and sorting from Story 2.2

**Test Data Generation:**
- Use mock data generator to create realistic issue datasets
- Generate variable project sizes (100-5000 files)
- Create historical run data for comparison testing
- Generate priority scores using Story 2.2 patterns

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.2 (Issue Prioritization Engine) - COMPLETED:
- Established IssuePrioritization data models with multi-factor scoring system
- Created modular engine pattern (IssuePrioritizationEngine, IssueClassifier, RuleEngine)
- Implemented strict TypeScript types with no 'any' usage
- Built comprehensive test coverage pattern for new features
- Prioritized issues now have scores and context that the dashboard MUST display

**Key Integrations Required from Story 2.2:**
```typescript
interface IssuePrioritization {
  id: string;
  issueId: string;
  severity: number; // 1-10 scale
  impact: number; // 1-10 scale
  effort: number; // 1-10 scale (estimated fix effort)
  businessValue: number; // 1-10 scale
  finalScore: number; // Calculated prioritization score
  context: IssueContext;
  classification: IssueClassification;
  triageSuggestion: TriageSuggestion;
}
```

Dashboard must display:
- Priority scores and badges based on finalScore
- Triage suggestions in issue detail views
- Sort/filter by any prioritization factor
- Visual indicators for severity and impact levels

### Data Models

**Existing Issue Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#issue]
```typescript
interface Issue {
  id: string;
  type: "error" | "warning" | "info";
  toolName: string;
  filePath: string;
  lineNumber: number;
  message: string;
  ruleId?: string;
  fixable: boolean;
  suggestion?: string;
  score: number; // Enhanced with prioritization
}
```

**AnalysisResult Structure** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#analysisresult]
```typescript
interface AnalysisResult {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  duration: number;
  overallScore: number;
  toolResults: ToolResult[];
  summary: ResultSummary;
  aiPrompts: AIPrompt[];
}
```

**CLI State Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-structure]
```typescript
interface CLIState {
  config: {
    currentProject: ProjectConfiguration | null;
    userPreferences: UserSettings;
    isLoading: boolean;
  };
  analysis: {
    currentResult: AnalysisResult | null;
    isRunning: boolean;
    progress: number;
    errors: AnalysisError[];
  };
  ui: {
    currentScreen: string;
    navigation: NavigationHistory[];
    theme: Theme;
  };
  cache: {
    hits: number;
    misses: number;
    size: number;
  };
}
```

- State Management: Zustand 4.4.0
- Database: SQLite 5.1.0 for persistent storage
- Logging: Winston 3.11.0

**CLI Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#cli-component-architecture]
- Component location: `apps/cli/src/components/`
- Hooks location: `apps/cli/src/hooks/`
- Services location: `apps/cli/src/services/`

  // Props definition
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = (props) => {
  // Component implementation
};

export default Component;
```

**State Management Pattern** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-patterns]
- Zustand stores for CLI state management
- Local component state for UI-specific state
- SQLite persistence for configuration/layouts
- Event-driven updates through event emitter pattern (NOT WebSockets)

**Database Schema for Dashboard Layouts**
```sql
-- Dashboard Layout Persistence Schema
CREATE TABLE dashboard_layouts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  is_preset BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  layout_config JSON NOT NULL, -- JSON structure for panel positions/sizes
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  user_id TEXT -- For user-specific layouts
);

CREATE TABLE dashboard_widgets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  layout_id INTEGER REFERENCES dashboard_layouts(id),
  widget_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'summary', 'issues', 'coverage', 'trends', etc.
  position JSON NOT NULL, -- {x, y, width, height}
  config JSON, -- Widget-specific configuration
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE filter_presets (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  filter_config JSON NOT NULL, -- Saved filter criteria
  is_global BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  user_id TEXT -- For user-specific presets
);
```

# Story 1.6: Turborepo Integration

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer working on the DevQuality CLI monorepo,
**I want** to use Turborepo to optimize build times and script execution,
**so that** development cycles are faster and more efficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Turborepo installed and configured in the monorepo
2. Pipeline configuration defined for build, test, lint operations
3. Intelligent build caching working between workspaces
4. Existing scripts maintained with full compatibility

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.5 (Basic CLI Dashboard):
- **Build Performance Issues**: Current builds are sequential without caching, causing slow development cycles
- **Package Dependencies**: Complex workspace dependencies need proper pipeline configuration
- **Development Workflow**: Need to maintain hot reload and development efficiency
- **CI/CD Integration**: Existing GitHub Actions workflow needs Turborepo integration

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Build Tools Integration:**
- **Bun 1.0.0**: Current build tool and runtime, will integrate with Turborepo
- **TypeScript 5.3.3**: Compilation across all workspaces
- **npm workspaces**: Current workspace management, will be enhanced by Turborepo

**CI/CD Stack:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Current CI/CD platform, needs Turborepo integration
- **Node.js 18+**: Runtime environment for CI/CD

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Current Monorepo Structure:**
```
dev-quality-cli/
├── apps/cli/                 # Main CLI application
├── packages/
│   ├── core/                # Core functionality
│   ├── types/               # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── utils/               # Shared utilities
│   └── plugins/             # Analysis tool plugins
```

**Pipeline Configuration Requirements:**
- Build dependencies: packages must build before apps/cli
- Test dependencies: tests run after successful builds
- Lint independence: linting can run in parallel across workspaces

### Build Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Current CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Build Command: `bun run build`
- Test Command: `bun run test:coverage`
- Lint Command: `bun run lint`
- Type Check: `bun run typecheck`

**Turborepo Integration Points:**
- Replace sequential builds with cached parallel builds
- Maintain script compatibility for development workflow
- Configure remote caching for CI/CD performance

### Development Workflow

[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

**Current Development Commands:**
```bash
bun run build          # Build all packages
bun run build:packages # Build packages only
bun run build:cli      # Build CLI only
bun run test           # Run tests
bun run lint           # Run linting
bun run dev            # Development mode
```

**Turborepo Migration Requirements:**
- Maintain all existing script interfaces
- Add Turborepo-specific commands for advanced usage
- Configure development pipeline for hot reload
- Preserve environment variable configurations

### File Structure for Turborepo

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `turbo.json` - Turborepo configuration
- `package.json` - Updated with Turborepo scripts
- `.gitignore` - Add .turbo/ directory
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD integration

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements:**
- Build total time must be at least 3x faster than current (~90s → <30s)
- Cache hit rate must be >80% for repeated builds
- Incremental builds for single packages must be <10s
- Test execution time must improve (~120s → <60s)

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Zero breaking changes to existing npm scripts
- Full backward compatibility for development workflow
- All existing CI/CD functionality preserved
- Environment variables and configuration preserved

### Coding Standards

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Build Standards:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode across all builds
- Maintain ESLint compliance in build process
- Ensure proper error handling in build scripts
- Use consistent file path utilities for cross-platform compatibility

**Performance Standards:**
- Cache expensive operations when possible
- Clean up temporary files and objects after builds
- Handle build errors gracefully with proper recovery

### Testing

**Test Standards from Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `packages/*/tests/unit/`, `apps/cli/tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `apps/cli/tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Frontend Tests**: Vitest for CLI components
- **Backend Tests**: Bun Test for core functionality
- **E2E Tests**: Shell command validation

**Testing Requirements for Turborepo Integration:**
- Test all existing scripts work with Turborepo commands
- Test build caching behavior with cache hit/miss scenarios
- Test incremental builds with single package changes
- Test parallel script execution performance
- Test CI/CD integration with remote caching
- Test error handling and graceful degradation
- Test performance with large codebases (1000+ files)

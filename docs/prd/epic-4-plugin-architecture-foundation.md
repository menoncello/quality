# Epic 4: Plugin Architecture Foundation

**Goal**: Create extensible plugin system, SDK, and registry for community contributions and future expansion to support diverse quality tools and use cases.

## Story 4.1 Plugin System Core Architecture

As a developer, I want a robust plugin system architecture, so that I can extend the tool's functionality and integrate with additional quality tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin lifecycle management (load, initialize, execute, unload)
2. API versioning and backward compatibility
3. Plugin configuration and settings management
4. Inter-plugin communication capabilities
5. Security sandboxing for third-party plugins
6. Performance monitoring and optimization

## Story 4.2 Plugin SDK Development

As a plugin developer, I want a comprehensive SDK with documentation and examples, so that I can easily create and distribute quality tool plugins.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin development framework and APIs
2. Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
3. Example plugins for common patterns
4. Testing utilities and frameworks
5. Debugging and development tools
6. Performance profiling and optimization guides

## Story 4.3 Plugin Registry and Distribution

As a plugin developer, I want a centralized registry for plugin discovery and distribution, so that I can share my plugins with the community.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin registry website and API
2. Plugin verification and security scanning
3. Version management and dependency resolution
4. User ratings and reviews system
5. Plugin analytics and usage statistics
6. Automated build and publishing pipeline

## Story 4.4 Security and Performance Management

As a developer, I want robust security and performance management for plugins, so that I can safely use third-party extensions without compromising my project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin sandboxing and isolation
2. Resource usage monitoring and limits
3. Security scanning and vulnerability detection
4. Performance benchmarking and optimization
5. Plugin failure recovery and graceful degradation
6. Audit logging and compliance reporting

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Eliminate friction in code quality through zero-configuration of testing tools and AI-powered insights for improvement
- Provide immediate test coverage analysis and actionable suggestions through a single command
- Reduce setup time from 30+ minutes to under 2 minutes for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- Increase test coverage by 25% in projects using the tool consistently
- Deliver a unified analysis combining test coverage, linting, formatting, and TypeScript validation

## Background Context

The DevQuality CLI addresses the critical pain point of inconsistent test tool configuration and fragmented insights that lead to preventable bugs and delayed improvements. Current developers face multiple challenges: complex configuration requirements for tools like Jest, Vitest, and Istanbul; lack of unified visibility across test results, coverage, and quality metrics; and manual analysis requirements to identify uncovered areas. The solution revolutionizes code quality analysis through automatic configuration of the Bun test + ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript stack, providing unified insights and practical suggestions specifically optimized for the Bun ecosystem.

# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Goal**: Establish project setup, auto-configuration wizard, and unified analysis engine delivering basic quality insights to provide immediate value and foundation for future features.

## Story 1.1 Project Setup and CLI Framework ✅ **DONE**

As a developer, I want a basic CLI framework with project structure and dependency management, so that I have a solid foundation for building the DevQuality tool.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Monorepo structure established with clear package boundaries
2. Core dependencies (TypeScript, Bun, Commander.js, Ink) configured
3. Basic CLI command structure implemented
4. Development environment setup with linting and testing configured
5. Package configuration supports both development and distribution

## Story 1.2 Auto-Configuration Detection Engine

As a developer, I want the CLI to automatically detect my project structure and existing tool configurations, so that I can get intelligent setup recommendations without manual configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Project type detection (JavaScript/TypeScript, package.json analysis)
2. Existing tool detection (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, current test framework)
3. Configuration file analysis and validation
4. Dependency version compatibility checking
5. Project structure assessment (single package vs complex layouts)

## Story 1.3 Setup Wizard Implementation

As a developer, I want an interactive setup wizard that configures the Bun-based tool stack automatically, so that I can go from installation to running analysis in under 2 minutes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Interactive CLI wizard with step-by-step configuration
2. Automatic Bun test configuration generation
3. ESLint and Prettier configuration setup with project-specific rules
4. TypeScript integration with proper compiler options
5. Configuration validation and testing
6. Rollback capability for failed configurations

## Story 1.4 Unified Analysis Engine Core ✅ **DONE**

As a developer, I want a core analysis engine that can execute and aggregate results from multiple quality tools, so that I get consistent, unified insights across all quality dimensions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Plugin-based architecture for tool integration
2. Result normalization and aggregation pipeline
3. Concurrent execution of quality checks for performance
4. Error handling and graceful degradation
5. Basic result reporting with summary metrics
6. Extensible tool adapter interface

## Story 1.5 Basic CLI Dashboard

As a developer, I want a clean CLI dashboard that shows analysis results in an organized, prioritized manner, so that I can quickly understand and address quality issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Color-coded issue display by severity
2. Basic metrics summary (coverage percentage, error counts)
3. Interactive navigation through results
4. Filterable and sortable issue lists
5. Export capabilities for basic reports
6. Progress indicators during analysis

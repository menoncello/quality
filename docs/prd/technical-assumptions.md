# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will use a monorepo structure with clear package boundaries to support the plugin architecture envisioned for post-MVP development.

## Service Architecture

**Service Architecture: Event-Driven with Plugin System**

The core architecture will be event-driven with adapters for different tools (Bun test, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript). This enables extensible functionality through a plugin system while maintaining backward compatibility through versioned APIs.

## Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

Comprehensive testing approach including unit tests for core functionality, integration tests for tool interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete workflows. Manual testing convenience methods will be provided for validation.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- TypeScript with Bun as the primary development runtime, with Node.js API fallback layer for compatibility
- SQLite for local caching and historical data (optional feature)
- CLI framework using Commander.js with Ink for interactive UI components
- Plugin SDK for community extensions with security sandboxing
- Performance optimization through incremental analysis and caching mechanisms
- Distribution via npm registry with GitHub for source control and issue tracking

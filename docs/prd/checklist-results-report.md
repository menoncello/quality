## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:**

- Epic definitions lack detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- Missing cross-functional requirements for integrations
- Technical architecture needs more specificity

**HIGH:**

- MVP scope could be further refined to ensure true minimality
- User stories need better sizing for AI agent execution
- Performance requirements need more specific benchmarks

**MEDIUM:**

- Plugin architecture could be deferred to post-MVP
- Some functional requirements could be more specific
- Testing strategy needs more detail

**LOW:**

- Branding guidelines could be more specific
- Documentation requirements could be expanded

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Features that might be cut for true MVP:**

- Plugin architecture (move to post-MVP)
- Advanced AI prompt generation
- Comprehensive reporting system
- Continuous quality monitoring

**Missing features that are essential:**

- Detailed acceptance criteria for all stories
- Integration testing requirements
- Performance benchmarks and validation
- Security implementation specifics

**Complexity concerns:**

- Auto-configuration wizard may be more complex than anticipated
- Unified analysis engine requires careful architecture
- Issue prioritization engine needs ML expertise

**Timeline realism:**

- 3-4 month MVP timeline is realistic with current scope
- First epic should deliver value quickly
- Plugin architecture adds significant complexity

## Technical Readiness

**Clarity of technical constraints:**

- Well-defined technology stack (Bun, TypeScript, Commander.js)
- Clear architectural patterns (event-driven, plugin-based)
- Good understanding of performance requirements

**Identified technical risks:**

- Complex integration with multiple quality tools
- Performance requirements may be challenging
- Plugin security model needs careful design

**Areas needing architect investigation:**

- Plugin architecture security sandboxing
- Performance optimization strategies
- Integration patterns with external tools
- Data storage and caching strategies

## Recommendations

**Specific actions to address each blocker:**

1. **Expand epic stories**: Add detailed acceptance criteria and implementation details
2. **Define integration requirements**: Specify external system integrations and APIs
3. **Refine technical architecture**: Provide more specific architectural guidance

**Suggested improvements:**

1. **Prioritize core functionality**: Focus on essential features for MVP
2. **Add performance benchmarks**: Define specific performance requirements
3. **Enhance testing strategy**: Include comprehensive testing requirements
4. **Refine user stories**: Ensure stories are appropriately sized for AI agents

**Next steps:**

1. **Review and refine**: Address identified gaps in requirements
2. **Architecture planning**: Begin technical architecture design
3. **Validation planning**: Plan MVP validation approach
4. **Stakeholder review**: Get final approval on refined requirements

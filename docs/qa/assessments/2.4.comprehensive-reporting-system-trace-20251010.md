### Critical Gaps

1. **Team Collaboration Integrations (AC4)**
   - Gap: No integration tests for Slack, Teams, email, or GitHub
   - Risk: High - Core feature completely missing
   - Action: Implement integration services with proper mocking

2. **Automated Scheduling System (AC3)**
   - Gap: No scheduling or automation functionality implemented
   - Risk: High - Key acceptance criterion not addressed
   - Action: Create scheduler service with cron integration

3. **Template Security Validation (AC2)**
   - Gap: XSS prevention and template security not tested
   - Risk: Medium - Security vulnerability potential
   - Action: Add security validation tests for template processing

4. **AI-Assisted Executive Summaries (AC5)**
   - Gap: Basic summary generation exists but AI enhancement missing
   - Risk: Medium - Feature not fully implemented as specified
   - Action: Implement AI-powered insight generation

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Integration Tests Needed:**
   - Slack service webhook delivery
   - Email service SMTP functionality
   - GitHub service API interactions
   - Scheduler service cron execution

2. **Performance Tests Required:**
   - Large dataset report generation (10K issues)
   - Historical data processing performance
   - Concurrent report generation limits

3. **Security Tests Essential:**
   - Template XSS prevention
   - Input sanitization for custom templates
   - File path validation for exports

4. **End-to-End Tests:**
   - Complete report generation workflow
   - Scheduled report automation
   - Multi-format export validation

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC4 (Team integrations) - No implementation found
- **High Risk**: AC3 (Scheduling/automation) - Core functionality missing
- **Medium Risk**: AC2 (Template security) - Partial coverage, security implications
- **Medium Risk**: AC5 (AI summaries) - Basic implementation exists, enhancement needed
- **Low Risk**: AC6 (Trend analysis) - Foundation exists, enhancement required
- **Low Risk**: AC1 (Export formats) - Comprehensive coverage achieved

### Overall Assessment

The reporting system has solid foundational coverage for core functionality (export formats, basic template system, executive summaries). However, critical features for team collaboration and automated scheduling are completely missing, representing significant gaps in the acceptance criteria implementation.

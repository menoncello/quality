  **Testing Focus**: Unit tests for plugin lifecycle, integration tests with mock plugins, dependency resolution scenarios

### 2. TECH-002: Concurrent Execution Race Conditions

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Multiple concurrent operations increase race condition probability
**Impact**: High - Could cause incorrect analysis results or system instability
**Mitigation**:
- Use proper synchronization patterns (Mutexes, Semaphores)
- Implement comprehensive concurrent testing framework
- Add detailed logging for debugging race conditions
  **Testing Focus**: Load testing with concurrent plugin execution, race condition detection tools, stress testing scenarios

### 3. PERF-001: Analysis Timeout (>2 min)

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex analysis with multiple tools could exceed performance targets

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

1. **Concurrent Execution Testing**
   - Multiple plugin execution scenarios with varying loads
   - Race condition detection using specialized tools
   - Resource contention testing under stress
   - Timeout handling validation with artificial delays
   - Worker thread utilization efficiency testing

2. **Plugin Architecture Testing**
   - Plugin lifecycle management (initialize, execute, cleanup)
   - Dependency resolution scenarios with complex plugin graphs
   - Error handling and cleanup for plugin failures
   - Sandbox isolation validation with malicious plugin simulation
   - Plugin registration and discovery system testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Sub-2-minute analysis benchmarks across project sizes
   - Large project performance validation (1000+ files)
   - Memory usage monitoring and leak detection
   - Cache effectiveness testing with cache hit/miss ratios
   - Concurrent execution performance profiling

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

1. **Result Aggregation Testing**
   - Cross-tool result normalization with diverse tool outputs
   - Accuracy validation using known project analysis results
   - Edge case handling (empty results, malformed outputs)
   - Consistency checks across multiple analysis runs
   - Score calculation accuracy verification

2. **Memory Management Testing**
   - Large project analysis with memory profiling
   - Memory leak detection during extended analysis sessions
   - Garbage collection optimization validation
   - Resource cleanup verification after plugin execution
   - Memory usage patterns under concurrent load

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

1. **Security Testing**
   - Input validation testing with malicious payloads
   - Sandbox isolation verification using escape attempts
   - Command injection prevention validation
   - Resource limit enforcement testing
   - Path traversal prevention in file operations

2. **Operational Testing**
   - Plugin deployment scenarios in various environments
   - Configuration validation with malformed inputs
   - Error monitoring and alerting system testing
   - Documentation completeness and accuracy verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (TECH-001, TECH-002, PERF-001) must be fully mitigated
- Performance benchmarks must consistently meet sub-2-minute target
- Concurrent execution must pass comprehensive race condition testing
- Plugin architecture must demonstrate stability under load

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks (PERF-002, DATA-001) with monitoring and alerting in place
- Low risks (SEC-001, OPS-001) with proper safeguards and documentation
- Performance monitoring dashboard operational
- Error handling and recovery procedures documented

### Accepted Risks

- No risks will be accepted without proper mitigation strategies
- All risks require monitoring triggers and escalation procedures
- Team sign-off required for any residual risks

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Analysis execution times, plugin performance, concurrent execution efficiency
- **Resource Metrics**: Memory usage patterns, CPU utilization, worker thread efficiency
- **Quality Metrics**: Plugin success/failure rates, result aggregation accuracy, error rates
- **Security Metrics**: Sandbox escape attempts, resource limit violations, validation failures
- **Operational Metrics**: Plugin deployment success, configuration validation results

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly or new plugin types added
- Performance benchmarks show degradation or inconsistent results
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in plugin system or sandboxing
- New tool integrations require complex adapter implementations
- User feedback indicates analysis quality or performance issues

## Risk Score Calculation

Base Score: 100
- Critical risks (9): 0 × 20 = 0 deduction
- High risks (6): 3 × 10 = 30 deduction
- Medium risks (4): 2 × 5 = 10 deduction
- Low risks (2-3): 2 × 2 = 4 deduction

Final Score: 100 - 30 - 10 - 4 = 76/100

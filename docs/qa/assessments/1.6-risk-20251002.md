## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Build Pipeline Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Turborepo introduces new concepts like pipelines, dependencies, and caching that may be unfamiliar to the team
**Impact**: High - Could break entire build process across all packages

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple pipeline configuration
- Comprehensive testing of all build scenarios
- Rollback plan with existing npm scripts
- Team training on Turborepo concepts

**Testing Focus**: Build verification across all packages, dependency validation, rollback testing

### 2. TECH-002: Cache Invalidation Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Cache invalidation is notoriously difficult to get right
**Impact**: Medium - Would cause inconsistent builds but recoverable with cache clearing

**Mitigation**:
- Careful configuration of outputs and cache keys
- Manual cache clearing procedures
- Monitoring cache hit rates
- Test incremental builds thoroughly

**Testing Focus**: Cache behavior validation, incremental build testing, cache corruption scenarios

### 3. OPS-001: CI/CD Integration Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - CI integration often requires environment-specific adjustments
**Impact**: High - Could block deployments and affect team productivity

**Mitigation**:
- Test Turborepo in staging CI environment first
- Configure cache persistence in CI
- Update CI workflows gradually
- Monitor CI build times and success rates

**Testing Focus**: End-to-end CI pipeline testing, cache persistence validation, build time measurement

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

1. **Build Pipeline Validation**
   - Test all package builds with Turborepo
   - Verify dependency management works correctly
   - Test build failures and error handling
   - Validate rollback procedures to npm scripts

2. **Cache Behavior Testing**
   - Test cache hit/miss scenarios
   - Validate cache invalidation on code changes
   - Test cache corruption recovery
   - Monitor cache performance metrics

3. **CI/CD Integration Testing**
   - Test Turborepo in CI environment
   - Validate cache persistence between builds
   - Test build time improvements
   - Verify deployment pipeline integrity

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

1. **Performance Validation**
   - Measure build times vs baseline
   - Test parallel execution of scripts
   - Validate incremental builds
   - Monitor resource usage

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

1. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Verify all existing npm scripts work
   - Test developer workflow continuity
   - Validate documentation accuracy

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (TECH-001, TECH-002, OPS-001) must have mitigations in place
- Performance targets must be validated (3x improvement not strictly required but significant improvement needed)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Low risks with rollback procedures documented

### Accepted Risks

- Cache corruption risk accepted with manual recovery procedures
- Minor performance regression accepted if overall improvement achieved

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Build Metrics**: Build times, success rates, cache hit rates
- **CI/CD Metrics**: Pipeline execution times, failure rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource usage, parallel execution efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Build feedback, error rates, workflow satisfaction

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Mitigations

1. **Phased Implementation**
   - Start with basic Turborepo configuration
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Maintain existing scripts as fallback

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test in isolated environment first
   - Validate all package builds
   - Test rollback procedures

3. **Cache Management**
   - Clear documentation of cache behavior
   - Manual cache clearing procedures
   - Monitoring cache effectiveness

### Operational Mitigations

1. **Team Training**
   - Turborepo concepts and best practices
   - New build procedures
   - Troubleshooting common issues

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - New build commands and procedures
   - Cache management guidelines
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Build times significantly increase (>50% from baseline)
- Cache hit rates fall below 60%
- CI/CD pipeline failures increase
- Team reports build system issues
- Performance targets not met

## Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic Turborepo configuration and add complexity gradually
2. **Maintain Backups**: Keep existing npm scripts as fallback during transition
3. **Monitor Closely**: Implement comprehensive monitoring of build metrics and cache behavior
4. **Team Training**: Invest in team education on Turborepo concepts and best practices
5. **Performance Validation**: Set realistic performance expectations and measure improvements objectively

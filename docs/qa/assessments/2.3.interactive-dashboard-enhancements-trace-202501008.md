### Critical Gaps

**No Critical Gaps Identified**

All critical acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage. The only gap identified is in AC5 (Customizable dashboard layouts), which is marked as incomplete in the story implementation itself.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive coverage, the following recommendations are made:

1. **AC5 Completion**: When task 78-91 are completed for customizable dashboard layouts, add comprehensive tests for:
   - Widget system functionality
   - Layout persistence and retrieval
   - User customization workflows
   - Layout import/export functionality

2. **Performance Test Expansion**: Consider adding more performance edge cases:
   - Real-time updates under extreme load (1000+ updates/second)
   - Memory stress testing with multiple concurrent analyses
   - Network failure scenarios during real-time updates

3. **Security Test Enhancement**: Add security tests for:
   - Layout configuration injection attacks
   - User input sanitization in layout names
   - Cross-user data isolation in multi-tenant scenarios

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: AC5 incomplete implementation (by design, not a testing gap)
- **Low Risk**: None identified

### Quality Indicators

**Excellent Traceability Quality:**
- ✅ Every implemented AC has comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Multiple test levels (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security)
- ✅ Story 2.2 integration fully validated
- ✅ Non-functional requirements (performance, security) explicitly tested
- ✅ Clear Given-When-Then documentation for all test mappings
- ✅ 100% requirements traceability for implemented features

### Test Coverage Statistics

- **Unit Tests**: 15 test files covering core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 5 test files covering component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: 3 test files covering 10K+ item scenarios
- **Security Tests**: 3 test files covering input validation and IDE integration
- **E2E Tests**: 2 test files covering complete user workflows

**Total Test Coverage**: Exceptional - All implemented features thoroughly tested across multiple dimensions.

- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 58/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: ML Model Implementation Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Story requires multiple ML components (IssueClassifier, feature extraction, training pipelines, model evaluation) with complex interdependencies
**Impact**: High - ML failures could break entire prioritization system, provide incorrect prioritizations, or cause system crashes
**Mitigation**:
- Implement ML components incrementally with fallback to rule-based prioritization
- Create comprehensive test suites for each ML component
- Start with simplified models and iteratively add complexity
- **Testing Focus**: ML model validation, failure scenarios, fallback mechanisms, training data quality

### 2. PERF-001: Large-Scale Issue Processing

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 30-second target for 10k+ issues with ML inference is ambitious given computational complexity
**Impact**: High - Performance failures could make system unusable for large projects, blocking adoption
**Mitigation**:
- Implement efficient caching for ML model results
- Use incremental processing and batch operations
- Add progress indicators and cancellation capabilities
- **Testing Focus**: Performance testing with large datasets, memory usage profiling, concurrency testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**ML Model Failure Scenarios**
- Test ML model loading failures and fallback to rule-based prioritization
- Validate graceful degradation when models are unavailable
- Test classification accuracy with various data quality scenarios
- Performance testing under memory pressure during ML inference

**Performance Under Load**
- Load testing with 10k+ issues to validate 30-second target
- Memory profiling during large dataset processing
- Concurrency testing for multiple simultaneous prioritization requests
- Cache performance and invalidation testing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Security and Privacy**
- Test data sanitization in training data collection
- Validate access controls on model files and training data
- Test encryption of sensitive classification data
- Audit logging for ML model access and modifications

**Data Compliance**
- Test GDPR/data retention compliance in training data
- Validate data anonymization processes
- Test consent mechanisms for external AI processing
- Backup/recovery testing for ML models and training data

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

**Integration Testing**
- Test compatibility with existing coverage analysis system
- Validate CLI command integration with new prioritization features
- Test database schema changes and migration
- Regression testing of existing coverage functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Both critical risks (TECH-001, PERF-001) must have comprehensive mitigations
- ML fallback mechanisms must be fully implemented and tested
- Performance targets must be validated with benchmark testing

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Security risks (SEC-001, DATA-001) can proceed with documented security controls
- Technical integration risk (TECH-002) acceptable with backward compatibility testing

### Accepted Risks

- None identified for initial deployment

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for issue processing time and memory usage
- ML model accuracy and prediction confidence scores
- Security alerts for unauthorized model access or data exposure
- Error rates for ML model failures and fallback usage

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- ML model accuracy drops below acceptable thresholds
- Performance issues reported with large issue sets
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in ML implementation
- New regulatory requirements affect data processing
- Architecture changes impact ML pipeline

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Risk Score: 58/100 (Moderate-High Risk)**

This story presents significant technical challenges due to the ML implementation complexity and performance requirements. However, with proper risk mitigation strategies and comprehensive testing, the risks can be managed effectively.

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize implementing fallback mechanisms before advanced ML features
2. Invest heavily in performance testing and optimization early
3. Implement comprehensive security controls for data handling
4. Consider phasing ML features incrementally to reduce complexity

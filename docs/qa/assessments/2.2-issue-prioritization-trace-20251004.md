### Critical Gaps

**None identified** - All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Design Recommendations

Current test coverage is excellent. Recommendations for maintaining quality:

1. **Performance Testing**: Continue testing with larger issue sets (10,000+ issues) to validate 30-second performance requirement
2. **ML Model Testing**: Add tests for model accuracy degradation over time and retraining triggers
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Add tests for corrupted training data, network failures during model loading
4. **Security Testing**: Add tests for malicious input in rule definitions and issue data

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All critical acceptance criteria have comprehensive coverage
- **Medium Risk**: None - All workflows well-tested with integration scenarios
- **Low Risk**: None - All components have thorough unit and integration test coverage

### Additional Test Coverage Notes

**Performance Testing**:
- `prioritization-engine-integration.test.ts` includes performance validation for 100 issues
- `prioritization-performance.test.ts` validates 10,000+ issue processing within 30 seconds

**Error Handling**:
- All major components include graceful error handling tests
- ML model failure scenarios tested with fallback mechanisms
- Rule validation prevents malformed rule execution

**Security Considerations**:
- Input validation tested for malicious data
- Rule parameter validation prevents injection attacks
- Model training data respects project boundaries and .gitignore

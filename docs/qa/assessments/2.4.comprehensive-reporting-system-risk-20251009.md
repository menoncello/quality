- **Critical Risks**: 2
- **High Risks**: 3
- **Overall Risk Score**: 7/100 (High Risk Story)

This story presents significant security and performance challenges that require immediate attention. The combination of template processing with user customization and strict performance requirements creates a high-risk implementation profile.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Template engine XSS vulnerabilities

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - User-customizable templates create a large attack surface
**Impact**: High - XSS attacks could compromise user data and system security

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization using DOMPurify
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to all HTML outputs
- Create a strict whitelist of allowed template functions
- Validate all template syntax before processing
- Escape all user-provided content by default

**Testing Focus**: OWASP ZAP security scanning, manual penetration testing with XSS payloads, unit tests for sanitization functions

### 2. PERF-001: Large dataset performance timeouts

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 10K issue reports are realistic for production use
**Impact**: High - System timeouts would cause failed reports and user dissatisfaction

**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming data processing for large datasets
- Add progress reporting and timeout handling
- Create background job queue for report generation
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Add caching for frequently accessed data

**Testing Focus**: Load testing with 10K+ issue datasets, performance profiling, memory usage monitoring during generation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Security Testing**
- XSS prevention in template processing with malicious payloads
- CSP header implementation and effectiveness
- Template function whitelist enforcement
- Input sanitization with edge cases

**Performance Testing**
- Load testing with 10K+ issue datasets
- Memory usage monitoring during report generation
- Timeout handling and recovery
- Background job queue processing

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Integration Testing**
- Multi-format export pipeline reliability
- Format validation and error handling
- Plugin architecture interface contracts
- Graceful degradation when formats fail

**Security Testing**
- Webhook validation bypass attempts
- Authentication token validation
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Audit trail completeness

**Database Testing**
- Corruption simulation and recovery
- Backup and restore procedures
- Data integrity validation
- Migration rollback testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Functional Testing**
- All export formats with sample data
- Template customization and rendering
- Scheduling configuration and execution
- External service integrations

**Operational Testing**
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Health checks and diagnostics
- Manual override procedures
- Error logging and troubleshooting

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All critical risks (SEC-001, PERF-001) must be fully mitigated
- High risks affecting security and data integrity must be addressed

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with compensating controls and monitoring
- Low risks with proper alerting and response procedures

### Accepted Risks
- Minor business risks around AI summary quality can be accepted with user notification
- Some operational risks can be accepted with manual backup procedures

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

**Security Monitoring**
- XSS attack attempts and blocks
- Webhook delivery failures and anomalies
- Authentication token usage patterns
- CSP violation reports

**Performance Monitoring**
- Report generation completion times
- Memory and CPU usage during generation
- Database query performance
- Queue depth and processing times

**Operational Monitoring**
- Scheduled report execution success rates
- External service integration health
- Database consistency check results
- Error rates and alert thresholds

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Template engine architecture changes significantly
- New export formats or customization options are added
- Performance requirements are modified
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered in similar systems
- External integration APIs change
- User requirements evolve significantly

## Recommendations

### Development Focus
1. **Security First**: Implement comprehensive XSS prevention before any template features
2. **Performance Engineering**: Design for large datasets from the beginning
3. **Modular Architecture**: Build pluggable system with clear interfaces
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Invest heavily in security and performance testing

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phased Rollout**: Start with limited template customization
2. **Feature Flags**: Use flags for risky features like custom templates
3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring before production
4. **Rollback Planning**: Have clear rollback procedures for critical components

### Quality Gates
1. **Security Review**: Mandatory security review before production
2. **Performance Validation**: Must pass 10K issue performance tests
3. **Integration Testing**: Full integration test suite must pass
4. **Security Scanning**: OWASP ZAP scan must show no critical vulnerabilities

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Real-time Update Performance Degradation

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Terminal UI updates with large datasets are inherently resource-intensive, especially with continuous streaming
**Impact**: High - Dashboard becomes unresponsive or unusable, defeating its primary purpose
**Mitigation**:
- Implement virtual scrolling/pagination for large datasets
- Add configurable update throttling (e.g., max updates per second)
- Use differential updates instead of full re-renders
- Implement data sampling for real-time view (show subset, full data on demand)
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with 10,000+ issues, performance profiling during updates

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 2. TECH-001: Complex State Management Across Multiple Views

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Multiple interconnected components with shared state
**Impact**: Medium - UI inconsistencies, race conditions, difficult debugging
**Mitigation**:
- Use single source of truth with Zustand store
- Implement state middleware for logging and debugging
- Add state validation layer
- Create comprehensive state transition tests
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for state transitions, edge case testing

### 3. SEC-001: XSS Through Unsanitized Search/Filter Inputs

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - User inputs in search/filter could contain malicious content
**Impact**: High - Code execution in terminal context
**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Use parameterized queries for SQLite
- Escape special characters in terminal output
- Implement input validation whitelist
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with OWASP patterns, fuzzing inputs

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Risk Mitigation (PERF-001)

**Strategy**: Preventive + Detective
**Actions**:
1. Implement virtual rendering for large datasets (show visible items only)
2. Add performance monitoring hooks to detect degradation
3. Create configurable update throttling (default: 10 updates/sec)
4. Implement progressive data loading
5. Add performance budget alerts (render time > 100ms)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance tests with 1K, 10K, 100K issues
- Memory profiling during 1-hour continuous updates
- CPU usage monitoring during real-time streaming
- User experience testing with various terminal sizes

**Residual Risk**: Low - Some performance impact with extreme datasets (>100K issues)

### High Risk Mitigations

**TECH-001 - State Management**:
- Implement Redux DevTools integration for Zustand
- Add state snapshot testing
- Create state migration utilities
- Document state flow diagrams

**SEC-001 - Input Sanitization**:
- Use DOMPurify-equivalent for terminal
- Implement CSP-like policies for CLI
- Add input validation middleware
- Create security test suite

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Performance Test Suite**:
  - Load testing with varying dataset sizes
  - Continuous update stress testing
  - Memory leak detection tests
  - Terminal render performance benchmarks

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **State Management Tests**:
  - State transition integration tests
  - Race condition detection
  - Multi-view synchronization tests

- **Security Tests**:
  - Input sanitization validation
  - Injection attack prevention
  - Terminal escape sequence testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard functional tests for all features
- IDE integration compatibility matrix
- Layout persistence reliability tests
- User experience validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-001: Real-time performance must handle 10K issues smoothly
- SEC-001: All user inputs must be sanitized
- TECH-001: State management must be predictable and debuggable

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-002: Document Ink limitations and workarounds
- PERF-002: Implement cleanup in useEffect hooks
- DATA-002: Add optimistic locking for updates
- BUS-001: Provide simplified preset layouts

### Accepted Risks
- OPS-001: IDE integration issues (graceful fallback exists)
- PERF-003: SQLite performance (adequate for expected usage)
- DATA-001: Layout corruption (low probability, manual recovery possible)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Dashboard render time (target: <100ms)
  - Update frequency (max: 10/sec)
  - Memory usage over time

- **Error Rates**:
  - State inconsistency errors
  - Input validation failures
  - IDE integration failures

- **User Metrics**:
  - Feature adoption rates
  - Layout customization usage
  - Performance complaint frequency

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Dataset size requirements increase beyond 100K issues
- New terminal UI framework considered
- Additional IDE integrations added

- User feedback indicates performance issues

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

3. Security input validation tests (High)
4. IDE compatibility matrix testing (Low)

### Development Focus
- Implement performance optimizations first

- Create robust state management patterns
- Document all workarounds for Ink limitations

### Deployment Strategy
- Beta test with power users for performance validation
- Feature flag real-time updates initially
- Gradual rollout of customization features
- Monitor performance metrics closely post-deployment

### Monitoring Setup
- Dashboard render time alerts (>100ms)
- Memory usage tracking (detect leaks)

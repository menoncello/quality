## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Configuration File Injection Attacks

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Configuration parsing will process untrusted files from user projects
**Impact**: High - Could lead to RCE through malicious config files or YAML/JSON injection
**Description**: Auto-configuration engine will parse arbitrary configuration files (package.json, eslint.config.js, etc.) which could contain malicious payloads targeting the parsing libraries.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parsed files
- Use secure parsing libraries with protection against prototype pollution
- Sandbox configuration parsing in isolated contexts
- Limit file size and complexity to prevent DoS
- Implement allow-list for supported configuration formats

**Testing Focus**:

- Penetration testing with malicious config files
- Fuzzing of configuration parsers
- Security testing for prototype pollution vulnerabilities
- Integration tests with known malicious patterns

### 2. TECH-001: Complex Integration with Multiple Configuration Systems

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Must integrate with diverse, often incompatible configuration systems
**Impact**: High - Could break existing project setups or generate incorrect configurations
**Description**: The engine needs to understand and integrate with multiple tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Jest, etc.) each with different configuration formats, versions, and potential conflicts.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement adapter pattern for each tool type
- Create comprehensive test matrix with real-world project configurations
- Add configuration validation and conflict detection
- Implement rollback functionality for generated configurations
- Provide clear error messages for unsupported configurations

**Testing Focus**:

- Integration testing with real project configurations
- Conflict detection and resolution testing
- Rollback functionality verification
- Edge case testing with unusual or broken configurations

## High Risks

### 3. PERF-001: File System Scanning Performance

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Large projects may have extensive directory structures
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause slow CLI response times and poor user experience
**Mitigation**: Implement intelligent scanning with caching, parallel processing, and directory exclusion patterns

### 4. DATA-001: Dependency Version Compatibility Issues

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex dependency trees with version conflicts
**Impact**: Medium - Could recommend incompatible tool versions
**Mitigation**: Build comprehensive compatibility matrix and implement robust version resolution logic

### 5. TECH-002: Cross-Platform Path Handling

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Path handling differs between Windows, macOS, and Linux
**Impact**: Medium - Could fail on certain platforms or produce incorrect paths
**Mitigation**: Use cross-platform path utilities and comprehensive testing on all platforms

## Medium Risks

### 6. OPS-001: Configuration Migration Failures

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Complex migration logic for existing configurations
**Impact**: Medium - Could leave projects in inconsistent state
**Mitigation**: Implement backup strategies and validation steps

### 7. BUS-001: Tool Recommendation Accuracy

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - May not always recommend optimal tool configurations
**Impact**: Medium - Could lead to suboptimal developer experience
**Mitigation**: Build recommendation engine with learning from real projects

## Low Risks

### 8. DATA-002: Privacy Concerns with Project Analysis

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Analysis is local and doesn't transmit data
**Impact**: Low - Limited to local project structure
**Mitigation**: Ensure all processing remains local and document data handling

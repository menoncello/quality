#### AC12: CI/CD pipeline integration - ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **CI Configuration**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` updated (mentioned in story)
  - Given: GitHub Actions workflow updated
  - When: CI pipeline executes
  - Then: Uses Turborepo commands with cache persistence

**Gap**: No automated tests found that validate the actual CI/CD integration functionality. The story mentions CI updates but test coverage focuses on local execution.

### Critical Gaps

1. **CI/CD Integration Testing**
   - Gap: No tests validate GitHub Actions workflow integration with Turborepo
   - Risk: Medium - CI issues could surface in production
   - Action: Add integration tests that simulate CI environment or validate CI configuration

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **CI/CD Integration Tests**
   - Add tests that validate turbo commands work in CI-like environments
   - Test cache persistence across CI runs
   - Validate environment variable passing in CI context

2. **Performance Regression Tests**
   - Continue monitoring build performance over time
   - Add alerts for performance degradation
   - Track cache efficiency metrics

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: CI/CD integration validation gap
- **Low Risk**: All other requirements have comprehensive test coverage

### Quality Indicators

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive test coverage for core Turborepo functionality
- Excellent performance measurement and validation
- Strong CLI compatibility testing
- Good test organization with clear Given-When-Then documentation

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add CI/CD integration validation tests
- Consider adding load testing for parallel execution limits

### Test Execution Environment

All identified tests are designed to:
- Run in local development environment
- Validate Turborepo-specific behavior
- Measure performance improvements
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Test error handling and edge cases

### Conclusion

Story 1.6 demonstrates excellent test coverage with 92% fully covered requirements. The implementation includes comprehensive performance validation, CLI compatibility testing, and robust error handling. The primary gap is CI/CD integration testing, which should be addressed to ensure complete end-to-end validation.

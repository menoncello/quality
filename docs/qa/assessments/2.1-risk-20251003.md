Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Coverage data parsing failures with complex test structures

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Complex test structures, edge cases in coverage formats, and varying Bun test output formats make parsing failures likely
**Impact**: High - Inaccurate coverage data could mislead developers about actual test coverage, potentially allowing untested code into production

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback parsing strategies
- Create extensive test suite with various coverage report formats
- Add validation against known coverage patterns
- Implement graceful degradation when parsing fails

**Testing Focus**:
- Unit tests for coverage parser with malformed inputs
- Integration tests with real Bun test coverage outputs
- Edge case testing with complex project structures

### 2. PERF-001: Performance bottlenecks with large project coverage analysis

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Coverage analysis requires processing all source files and test results; performance degradation is likely with large codebases
**Impact**: High - Could exceed the 2-minute performance target, making the tool unusable for medium-to-large projects

**Mitigation**:
- Implement efficient streaming parsers for coverage data
- Add parallel processing for file-level coverage analysis
- Implement incremental coverage analysis (process only changed files)
- Add caching for coverage results with intelligent invalidation

**Testing Focus**:
- Performance tests with synthetic large project datasets
- Memory usage profiling during coverage analysis
- Load testing with concurrent coverage requests

## High Risks

### 3. TECH-002: Integration complexity with existing plugin architecture

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Existing plugin system may require modifications for coverage-specific requirements
**Impact**: High - Could break existing functionality or require extensive refactoring

**Mitigation**:
- Thorough analysis of existing plugin interfaces before implementation
- Create integration tests with existing analysis plugins
- Implement backward compatibility layers

### 4. DATA-001: SQLite database performance with coverage history tracking

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Coverage history tables could grow rapidly and impact query performance
**Impact**: High - Slow trend analysis and degraded user experience

**Mitigation**:
- Implement database indexing strategy for coverage queries
- Add data retention policies for historical coverage data
- Implement data compression for historical coverage records

### 5. OPS-001: Complex deployment and configuration requirements

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Coverage analysis requires specific Bun test configurations and dependencies
**Impact**: High - Could fail in production environments or require complex setup

**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive installation and configuration documentation
- Implement configuration validation and error reporting
- Add health checks for coverage analysis components

## Medium Risks

### 6. TECH-003: CLI visualization complexity with Ink components

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Terminal-based coverage visualization has inherent complexity
**Impact**: Medium - Poor user experience or display issues in different terminal environments

**Mitigation**:
- Test across multiple terminal types and sizes
- Implement fallback text-based coverage reports
- Add comprehensive error handling for display issues

### 7. BUS-001: User adoption risk due to complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Advanced coverage analysis may be too complex for some users
**Impact**: Medium - Low adoption rates and user satisfaction

**Mitigation**:
- Implement progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Add simple coverage overview modes for basic use cases

## Low Risks

### 8. SEC-001: Data exposure through coverage reports

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Coverage reports typically contain only code structure information
**Impact**: Low - Limited security impact, but could expose internal code structure

**Mitigation**:
- Implement coverage report filtering options
- Add user consent prompts for sharing coverage data
- Validate coverage data doesn't contain sensitive information

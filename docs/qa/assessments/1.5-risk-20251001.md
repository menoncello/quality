## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks (score 9) identified. However, several high risks require attention.

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: React/Ink Terminal Interface Complexity

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High - Terminal UI frameworks commonly have rendering issues across different environments
**Impact**: Medium - Poor user experience but core functionality remains accessible
**Mitigation**:
- Create proof-of-concept with basic Ink components early
- Implement graceful degradation for non-interactive terminals
- Add comprehensive testing across different terminal sizes (80x24 minimum)
- Use Ink's built-in compatibility features

**Testing Focus**: Cross-platform terminal testing, automated UI testing with different terminal emulators

### 2. TECH-002: Integration with Analysis Engine

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium - Integration points typically have challenges but existing API documented
**Impact**: High - Could break entire dashboard functionality if integration fails
**Mitigation**:
- Create integration tests with mock analysis results early
- Implement adapter pattern for loose coupling between dashboard and analysis engine
- Add comprehensive error handling for analysis engine failures
- Use existing AnalysisEngine interface from story requirements

**Testing Focus**: Integration tests, mock analysis engine testing, error scenario testing

### 3. PERF-001: Large Dataset Rendering Performance

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High - Story explicitly mentions handling 1000+ issues requiring virtualization
**Impact**: Medium - Slow rendering but dashboard remains functional
**Mitigation**:
- Implement virtualization for large issue lists as specified in requirements
- Add pagination and efficient filtering (20-50 items per page)
- Use React.memo and useMemo for component optimization
- Performance testing with realistic large datasets

**Testing Focus**: Performance testing with 1000+ issues, memory usage monitoring, response time validation

### 4. SEC-001: File Export Path Traversal

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium - Export functionality with file path handling requires careful implementation
**Impact**: High - Security vulnerability if paths not properly sanitized
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict path validation and sanitization
- Use secure file writing utilities specified in story requirements
- Validate export paths against allowed directories only
- Follow existing security patterns from architecture

**Testing Focus**: Security testing, path traversal attack testing, malicious input validation

### 5. OPS-001: Terminal Compatibility Issues

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High - Different terminal sizes, color support, OS variations create compatibility challenges
**Impact**: Medium - Some users may have degraded experience but basic functionality remains
**Mitigation**:
- Implement terminal capability detection
- Provide fallback modes for limited terminals (no color, small size)
- Test across different OS (macOS, Linux, Windows) and terminal emulators
- Follow UI/UX constraint of 80x24 minimum terminal size

**Testing Focus**: Cross-platform compatibility testing, different terminal emulator testing

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks (2 high)
- Performance: 2 risks (1 high, 1 medium)
- Security: 1 risk (1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (1 medium)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 high)
- Business: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Frontend (CLI Dashboard): 5 risks
- Integration Layer: 2 risks
- Export Functionality: 1 risk

## Medium Risks

### PERF-002: Real-time Progress Updates
**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)** - Event system exists but real-time UI updates can be tricky

### DATA-001: Issue Data Transformation Accuracy
**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)** - Data transformation between analysis engine and dashboard needs validation

### BUS-001: CLI Dashboard Usability
**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)** - Interactive CLI interfaces can be unintuitive for some users

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Cross-platform terminal compatibility** - Test on macOS, Linux, Windows with different terminals
- **Large dataset performance** - Test with 1000+ issues to validate virtualization
- **Integration with analysis engine** - Test with real and mock analysis results
- **Export security** - Test file path validation and prevent path traversal attacks
- **Terminal UI rendering** - Test Ink components with different terminal sizes and capabilities

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Real-time progress updates** - Test event-driven UI updates during analysis
- **Data transformation accuracy** - Validate analysis results display correctly in dashboard
- **User interaction flows** - Test keyboard navigation and filtering usability

### Priority 3: Standard Tests

- **Unit tests** - Individual component testing
- **Functional tests** - Core dashboard functionality
- **Regression tests** - Ensure existing functionality remains intact

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: File export path traversal vulnerability
- TECH-002: Analysis engine integration failures
- PERF-001: Performance issues with large datasets

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: Terminal compatibility issues (provide fallback modes)
- OPS-001: Limited terminal support (document requirements)
- Medium risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- BUS-001: CLI dashboard usability (document limitations and provide user guide)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for large dataset rendering times
- Error rates for analysis engine integration failures
- Terminal compatibility issues reported by users
- Export operation success/failure rates
- User interaction patterns for usability assessment

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New terminal compatibility issues discovered
- Performance requirements change (larger datasets needed)
- Security vulnerabilities found in export functionality
- Analysis engine interface changes significantly
- User feedback indicates usability problems

## Recommendations

1. **Development Priority**: Focus on terminal compatibility and performance optimization early
2. **Security Focus**: Implement strict path validation for export functionality
3. **Testing Strategy**: Emphasize cross-platform and performance testing
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear terminal requirements and user guide
5. **Monitoring**: Track usage patterns and performance metrics post-launch

**Gate Recommendation**: CONCERNS - Several high risks identified but all have clear mitigation strategies. No critical risks that would block development.

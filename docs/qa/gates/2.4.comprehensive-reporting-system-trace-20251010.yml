notes: |
  Core reporting functionality (AC1) has excellent coverage with comprehensive format testing.
  Executive summary generation (AC5) is well-tested at basic level but needs AI enhancement.
  Major gaps exist in team integrations (AC4) and automation (AC3) which are critical features.
  Template system (AC2) has foundation but missing security validation which is important.
  Trend analysis (AC6) has partial implementation but needs completion for full functionality.

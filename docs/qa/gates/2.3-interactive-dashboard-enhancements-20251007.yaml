concerns:
  - type: "SECURITY"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "No input sanitization tests for search/filter operations"
    impact: "XSS vulnerability possible through user inputs"
    requirements: ["2.3-UNIT-004", "2.3-UNIT-005", "2.3-UNIT-018"]

  - type: "PERFORMANCE"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "No real-time update performance tests"
    impact: "Could fail under production load with 10K+ items"
    requirements: ["2.3-UNIT-012", "2.3-UNIT-013", "2.3-INT-011", "2.3-INT-012"]

  - type: "COVERAGE"
    severity: "HIGH"
    description: "No integration or E2E test coverage"
    impact: "Component interactions and user journeys unvalidated"
    requirements: ["All 2.3-INT-* and 2.3-E2E-* tests"]

  - type: "FEATURE"
    severity: "HIGH"
    description: "Core features completely untested"
    impact: "AC3 (Comparative Analysis), AC4 (Real-time Updates), AC5 (Layouts), AC6 (IDE Integration)"
    requirements: ["All tests for AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6"]

strengths:
  - type: "INTEGRATION"
    description: "Story 2.2 prioritization integration fully tested"
    coverage: "Complete unit test coverage for priority badges and triage suggestions"

  - type: "NAVIGATION"
    description: "Navigation components have solid unit test coverage"
    coverage: "Dashboard navigator, breadcrumbs, and virtualized list tested"

  - type: "PERFORMANCE"
    description: "Performance testing framework established"
    coverage: "10K item performance tests implemented and passing"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Implement input sanitization tests (2.3-UNIT-004, 2.3-UNIT-005, 2.3-UNIT-018)"
    - "Implement real-time update performance tests (2.3-UNIT-012, 2.3-UNIT-013)"
    - "Implement memory management tests (2.3-INT-011)"
    - "Implement large dataset rendering tests (2.3-INT-012)"

  short_term:
    - "Complete filter state management integration tests"
    - "Implement comparative analysis unit and integration tests"
    - "Add IDE integration tests"
    - "Create E2E tests for critical user journeys"

  quality_improvements:
    - "Establish integration test environment with real Zustand store"
    - "Create E2E test environment with full application running"
    - "Implement security-focused testing practices"
    - "Add continuous performance monitoring"

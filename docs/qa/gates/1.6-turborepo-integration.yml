findings:
  critical: []
  major:
    - type: "TEST_GAP"
      description: "Missing script output consistency validation"
      impact: "Medium - potential developer experience differences"
      recommendation: "Add tests comparing npm script outputs before/after Turborepo"
    - type: "TEST_GAP"
      description: "Missing comprehensive CLI command compatibility tests"
      impact: "Medium - potential undiscovered breaking changes"
      recommendation: "Add integration tests covering all CLI commands"
  minor:
    - type: "METRIC_GAP"
      description: "No quantitative parallel execution efficiency measurements"
      impact: "Low - performance improvements validated but not quantified"
      recommendation: "Add performance monitoring for parallelization efficiency"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Implement script output consistency tests before final release"
    - "Add comprehensive CLI command compatibility validation"
  short_term:
    - "Add quantitative parallel execution efficiency monitoring"
    - "Expand API compatibility test coverage"
  long_term:
    - "Maintain performance regression tests for ongoing monitoring"
    - "Regular cache efficiency monitoring and optimization"

evidence:
  performance:
    - "Initial build all packages: 1.56s → Cached build: 616ms (60% improvement)"
    - "Test execution: 13.28s → 98ms (99% improvement)"
    - "Lint execution: 1.97s → 153ms (92% improvement)"
    - "Incremental builds: 112ms for single package changes"
    - "Cache hit rate: 100% for unchanged packages"
    - "Cache size: Efficient 304K storage"
  ci_integration:
    - "GitHub Actions updated with Turborepo commands"
    - "Cache persistence configured across pipeline stages"
    - "All CI jobs (test, lint, build) using Turborepo successfully"
  compatibility:

    title: 'Configuration File Injection Attacks'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement secure configuration parsing with input validation and sandboxing'
      - 'Build comprehensive integration test matrix with real-world configurations'
      - 'Add configuration validation and conflict detection system'
    monitor:
      - 'Security alerts for configuration parsing vulnerabilities'
      - 'Performance metrics for file system scanning operations'
      - 'Error rates for integration failures'
      - 'User feedback on recommendation accuracy'

# Gate Decision: CONCERNS
# Rationale: 2 critical risks requiring immediate mitigation before production deployment
# Next Steps: Address critical security and integration risks, then re-evaluate

# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for DevQuality CLI, including CLI interface, backend analysis engine, and potential future web components. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines CLI tooling with extensible architecture for future GUI components, streamlining the development process for modern developer tools that bridge command-line and web interfaces.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield CLI Project**

This is a new CLI tool project designed from scratch with modern TypeScript/Bun tooling. No existing starter templates or legacy codebases are being used, allowing for optimal architecture decisions without migration constraints.
